# Getting Started with BlogZ application

This is the start of a Weblog application project.

These modules considered to be developed on this project:
User Login, Registration, Post a new blog, Commenting, Chat, etc..

I appreciate your collaboration with any `new ideas` or `code improvement` if you are interested.

# Running on localhost

Make a .env file in the root and make your envirounment variables which are needed in the codes.

To install node modules:

### `npm install`

Make assets/images folder under public folder to upload the blog posters.

### `node server.js`

### `npm start`
